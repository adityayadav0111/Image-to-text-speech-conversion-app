# Image to Text and Speech Conversion System

This project is a **web-based application** that extracts text from images and converts it into both readable text and audible speech. The system is built using advanced **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology, text translation, and speech synthesis to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features:
- **Text Extraction**: Uses Tesseract OCR to accurately detect and extract text from images.
- **Multilingual Translation**: Integrates Google Translate to convert extracted text into multiple languages.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts text (original or translated) into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **Web Application**: Built with Flask, offering an intuitive interface for image uploads, text viewing, and audio playback.

## Use Cases:
- **Accessibility**: Assists visually impaired users by converting written text into speech.
- **Language Learning**: Facilitates multilingual support for educational purposes.
- **Document Processing**: Automates the reading and conversion of scanned documents.

## Technologies Used:
- **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction
- **Google Translate API** for multilingual support
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** for audio conversion
- **Flask** as the web framework
- **HTML/CSS** for the frontend

## How to Use:
1. Upload an image containing text.
2. The system extracts the text using OCR.
3. (Optional) Choose a language to translate the text.
4. Convert the text into speech and download the audio file.
