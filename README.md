# Image-to-text-speech-conversion-app
The Image to Text and Speech Conversion System extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR and converts it into both readable text and audible speech. It supports multiple languages through Googleâ€™s translation services, and the text-to-speech conversion is handled by the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API.
